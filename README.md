# jplace_analysis
Scripts for parsing and analyzing jplace files

### jparse_int_leaf
takes a jplace files and counts the number of internal placements and leaf placements on the tree

### cog_func_placement_difference
takes all the jplace files from a metagenomic sample analysis and returns internal vs leaf placement for each functional class of cogs.

### outlaw_code
one off code that should be avoided

### Ideas
separate the cogs based on functional class (what functional family the cog belongs too) 
Check if inner placements are ambiguous or placed to specific level. as in, using ncbi tax id, what level is it identified at.
